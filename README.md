# PeekOrd
**A minimal python library for peeking ordering algorithms.**

This library will provide a list extension containing wrapped objects that will record and log information gained by comparisons (<, >) and provide:
* A selection of frames that can be queried for:
  * Information content in bits or nats.
  * Known order.
  * Export order information as po-set. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set)
* Simple sorting and merge algorithms.
* GUI for inspecting snapshots
