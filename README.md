# PeekOrd
**A minimal python library for peeking ordering algorithms.**

This library will provide a list extension containing wrapped objects that will record and log information gained by comparisons (<, >) and provide:
* A selection of snapshots that can be queried for:
  * Information content in bits or nats.
  * Known order.
  * Export order information as Lattice. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order))
* Simple sorting and merge algorithms.
* GUI for inspecting snapshots
